Here are answers to commonly asked questions. I appreciate your interests in my work and process, but it does take time to answer them individually. If I answer you privately, I will only reach one person, but by writing here, I can reach more people. This post is updated from time to time.

### What softwares do you use?

All my personal works are created with code. I only use GUI-based softwares (ie. Adobe) when work requires or when I need to retouch or export files for presentation. I use the JavaScript programming language (and sometimes, GLSL shading language) to create almost all my work.

### What programming language/libraries do you use?

I use my own creative coding tool called [Ssam.js](https://github.com/cdaein/ssam). Another tool that I use a lot is [Thing Umbrella](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella). I like to keep my code modular for reusability and maintainability, and created [a collection of small packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~daeinc) that I always use for math, geometry, animation, etc.

### Do you use TouchDesigner?

No.

### Can I see your source code?

Many of my creative _tools_ are open sourced and anyone can use them. But I do not usually put up code of my _work_. I am constantly iterating and it's not very well organized. I don't think there is something very special about the techniques that I use that you cannot find elsewhere on the internet.

### Can you help me with programming questions?

Unfortunately no. My time and resources are limited so I cannot help you personally. Here are a few suggestions for you, though. Web search is your friend. You need to have the patience to go through many scattered information online and filter through what you need. This takes time but it is a very good skill to develop if you want to be an independent learner. Second, use forums such as [Processing and p5js](https://discourse.processing.org). You will get much better help than individually asking artists for help. Also, use [Github](https://github.com) and [Codepen](https://codepen.io). There are many open source code examples. You just need to use the right search keywords. If you end up using someone else's code, make sure to credit them. Generative AI can be helpful at times, but beware of its shortcomings. Generally, I don't think it's good or safe enough yet for a complete beginner to learn an entirely new subject.

### How did you make [ a name of any of my work ]?

Whatever I make, it comes from months and years of practice and a combination of multiple techniques. It would be hard for me to tell you exactly how. It's not just techniques, either. I've been practicing art, design and motion for two decades. For most of the work you find interesting online, you may not find a tutorial that tells you everything step by step. Tutorials can be helpful, but at some point you will have to find your own directions. I suggest you build your fundamental skills first, and then break down a complex idea into small blocks and tackle them one by one. You may not recreate something you saw, but you will discover something much more exciting along the way.

### I always wanted to learn coding, but I don't know how to start.

If you are an absolute beginner, you need to just start. Just do it. Thinking about it doesn't do anything. Just do it. Take a few hours this weekend, find a very basic tutorial that has many views on Youtube, follow along, and just make something. You will have a ton of questions and will probably not understand much first time, and that's okay. It takes time to develop any skills. Think about the first time you learned a language - Engligh, French, Korean, etc. It takes a lot of time and a lot of practice to learn a language and it's same with a programming language. If you don't fully understand the tutorial, find another one on a similar topic. And find another one. After you've gone through several tutorials from different instructors on the same topic, you will start to notice what is essential and what is not. As you spend more time with the material, you will naturally feel more comfortable and confident. This is a great way to learn. You will also learn much more by actually creating something than just reading, watching or copying tutorials. If you can afford, sign up for a paid course or two. This may give you a better motivation. If you can afford some more, hire a tutor.

### Do you have tutorials?

If you are a beginner, I highly recommend you start your coding journey with [Coding Train Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain) by Daniel Shiffman.

### What language should I learn?

There are many different programming languages and you might be wondering which one you should start with for the things you want to do - poster design, web design, interactive installations, etc. My advice - if you are a beginner, it doesn't really matter. Just pick any language and learn the basics. For most programming languages, the basic concepts are usually very similar. My recommendation is Javascript through the [p5js library](https://p5js.org/).
