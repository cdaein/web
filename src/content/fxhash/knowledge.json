        "description": "by Daeinc\nMarch 2023\n\n***\nThis token was created for THE PASSAGE: Pitch Drop experience, an interactive minting experience where your choices determine the design of your token.\n\nTo take part, please purchase an Edition 5 Coin on fx(hash) by HERE & NOW. The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n***\n\nWhat does it mean to \"know\" something? Just because we do not see it does not mean it is not there. It does not mean it is not happening. Many things take time and energy to happen and to be understood. \n\nLook at how long it takes for rocks to become sand and how ephemeral we are in the passage of time like drops in a waterfall that evaporate within a few seconds.\n\nBut they blend, collide, and hit a rock or two before they disappear. These are the moments that I cherish, that I find meaning from, even if no one will remember them. After all, it is small drops that turn rock into sand. It is grains of sand that change the surface of the Earth. \n\n## Guide\n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.  \n- Tested on MacOS 13.2.1 with Chromium 110.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction  \n- [spacebar] to play/pause.  \n- [s] to save PNG.  \n\n## URL Parameters  \n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600  \n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)  \n- [loop]: play as a loop. you can add a number to randomize. (ex. loop=1234) \n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 for hi-DPI screens.\n\n### License\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\nRefer to the included LICENSE.md for third-party library license information.",
