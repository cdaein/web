This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute. (ex. bpm=80)\n- [res]: shape resolution between 0 and 18. (ex. res=2)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n- [ar]: maximum aspect ratio. set to any value over 1. 1.2 by default.\n- [snap]: add the param to snap to pixel grid.\n\n## License\nCC BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, dom-events, hsv2rgb, keyframes, equations from easings.net, array shuffle from stackoverflow.",

This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute.

This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute.
