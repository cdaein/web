Animated illustration for the New York Times story, [How Word Lists Help — or Hurt — Crossword Puzzles](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/crosswords/wordlists-for-constructing-puzzles.html).

I had a generous lead time for this assignment, so I thought I would develop a proper design system as the crossword puzzle itself is based on a solid grid system. I had a lot of fun developing this software which can take various numbers of columns and rows, word lists and different types of transition animation.

<MediaGrid
  maxCols={2}
  media={[vid2, vid3]}
  alts={["work in progress video", "work in progress video"]}
  class="gap-8"
/>
