A series of experiments exploring motion and connections. I created a network
of nodes with a custom growth simulation algorithm that is similar to
Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. Each node is created sequentially and remembers
its parents and children. By animating the nodes over generations, we get an
interesting insight into the makeup of the network.
