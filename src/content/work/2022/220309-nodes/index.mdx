A series of experiments exploring motion and connections. I created a network of nodes with a custom growth simulation algorithm that is similar to Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. Each node is created sequentially and remembers its parents and children. By animating the nodes over generations, we get an interesting insight into the makeup of the network.
