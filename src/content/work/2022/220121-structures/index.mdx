[Structures](https://objkt.com/@daeinc?fa_contract=KT1LjmAdYQCLBjwv4S2oFkEzyHVkomAf5MrW) is a series of programmed motion loops released on the Tezos blockchain. With this series, I am exploring rigid structures and their variations that I can create based on simple rules. Motion is essential in all of my work, Here, the only motion is colors changing. Any directional movement is an optical illusion. By using 1 dimensional change in 2 dimensional space, I can create many variations.

These loops are all created using my custom software, [Modular Design System One](/mds1). I originally developed the software to experiment with typography but it evolved into a tool that can handle abstract compositions as well. And that's how I usually end up with software-based work. The code is malleable and it usually leads me to explore directions that I have not thought of in the beginning.
