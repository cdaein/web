[Structures](https://objkt.com/@daeinc?fa_contract=KT1LjmAdYQCLBjwv4S2oFkEzyHVkomAf5MrW) is a series of programmed motion loops released on the Tezos blockchain. With this series, I am exploring rigid structures and their variations that I can create based on simple rules. Motion is essential in all of my work, Here, the only motion is colors changing. Any directional movement is an optical illusion. By using 1 dimensional change in 2 dimensional space, I can create many variations.
