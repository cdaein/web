[Time Intertwined](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/13526) is a generative NFT project that was launched on fxhash, and lives on the Tezos blockchain. There are 256 limited editions, each with unique properties.

Time Intertwined is my exploration into time and motion. Two linear timelines - structural and surficial - are intertwined. By weaving these timelines at different points in time, almost infinite variations can be made. The changing relationship between the two creates dynamic and unique compositions and challenges the visual perception.
