What does it mean to "know" something? Just because we do not see it does not mean it is not there. It does not mean it is not happening. Many things take time and energy to happen and to be understood.

Look at how long it takes for rocks to become sand and how ephemeral we are in the passage of time like drops in a waterfall that evaporate within a few seconds.

But they blend, collide, and hit a rock or two before they disappear. These are the moments that I cherish, that I find meaning from, even if no one will remember them. After all, it is small drops that turn rock into sand. It is grains of sand that change the surface of the Earth.

[Knowledge](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/26066) is a generative NFT project that was launched on fxhash, and lives on the Tezos blockchain.
