Sequenced is an exploration of generative motion compositions. Line segments are all connected in a loop and move within the constraints of a simple 2-dimensional grid structure. Each segment is assigned a sequence of motion data to follow, including rhythm units and the next positions. Some of the data is reused, while others are generated in real-time. Together, they act like a musical score but for the visuals. Sequenced falls somewhere between predictive sequences of rhythmical motion and endless random permutations.

While working on this project, I drew a parallel between music and generative art. The goal was not to emulate or directly translate music to visual, but rather to create a _memorable_ visual rhythm.

There are a few rules I set up for the temporal visual rhythm. The rules overlap and change the order over time, creating sometimes predictable and other times chaotic rhythm. You see and don't see a pattern at the same time. Ironically, I find it calming to watch the infinitely generated overlapping visual rhythm it creates.

Digital motion looks precise and has regularity but it can also go out of control pretty quickly with mathematically applied randomness. It is a balancing act to find an interesting middle ground between being too random and boring and being too precise and boring.
