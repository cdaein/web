[Sequenced](https://codecanvas.art/drop/8Dus2SwgbXATR6tGSjcKcFSAkmhpZD17g36kgpVz3Bpk) is a generative NFT project that was launched on Code Canvas, and lives on the Solana blockchain.

Sequenced is an exploration of generative motion compositions. Line segments are all connected in a loop and move within the constraints of a simple 2-dimensional grid structure. Each segment is assigned a sequence of motion data to follow, including rhythm units and the next positions. Some of the data is reused, while others are generated in real-time. Together, they act like a musical score but for the visuals. Sequenced falls somewhere between predictive sequences of rhythmical motion and endless random permutations.
