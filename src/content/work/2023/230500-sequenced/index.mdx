Sequenced is an exploration of generative motion compositions. Line segments
are all connected in a loop and move within the constraints of a simple
2-dimensional grid structure. Each segment is assigned a sequence of motion
data to follow, including rhythm units and the next positions. Some of the
data is reused, while others are generated in real-time. Together, they act
like a musical score but for the visuals. Sequenced falls somewhere between
predictive sequences of rhythmical motion and endless random permutations.
