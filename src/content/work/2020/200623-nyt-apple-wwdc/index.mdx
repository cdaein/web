Animated illustration for the New York Times story, [Apple Announces New Privacy Features](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/apple-announces-new-privacy-features.html).

I sampled the Apple logo to determine the size of each cube, and added sine-based animation on top. Created with Processing programming language.
