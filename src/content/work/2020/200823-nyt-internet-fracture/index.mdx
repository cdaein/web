Animated illustration for the New York Times story, _[Trumpâ€™s Attacks on TikTok and WeChat Could Further Fracture the Internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/technology/trump-tiktok-wechat-ban.html)._

I had a lot of fun creating this piece as I continued to experiment with Box2D physics simulation continuing from my previous assignment. This time, I added more interaction to literally express the fractured shapes.
