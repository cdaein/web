Animated illustration for the New York Times story, [The Internetâ€™s Most Censored Space](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/technology/the-internets-most-censored-space.html). This work was selected in [The Year in Illustration 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/14/multimedia/year-in-illustration.html) by the New York Times art directors.

As most of my NYT assignments have been, I only had a half-day to create this motion illustration from start to finish, but I wanted to try a different method of creating motion visually and conceptually. I used Processing programming lanuage and Box2D physics simulation library to create this piece. There is no keyframing and I recorded the mouse movement in real-time and later, edited in After Effects. By using the physics simulation, I was able to visually express the big ecosystem of App Store through abstract representation.
