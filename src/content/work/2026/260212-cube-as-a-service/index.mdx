[Cube-as-a-Service](https://caas.paperdove.com) (BETA) is a personal experiment that was built with the help of AI coding tools. You can upload your cover artwork images, add effects and adjust lighting to create a 3d preview. The original inspiration comes from [Bookup](https://bookup.marco.land).

I approach the AI with both curiosity and skepticism. I am beginning to find it useful in the narrow context of building software tools for myself and others especially in the area that big tech companies have zero or negative interests. I am also aware of the underlying issues surrounding LLMs. I am trying but struggling to navigate this new landscape just like many others are. Where do you draw the lines? Is there a way to make peace with this technology? Do small tools like this change your perception?
