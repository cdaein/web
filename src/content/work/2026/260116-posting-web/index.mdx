Posting Web improves upon [Posting](/posting) app that I created last year by running on a remote server 24/7 and adding the web interface for better usability.

The goal is the same as the last version — help users spend as little time as possible on the social media platforms while still maintaing their presence. When I upload posts directly on each platform, I tend to get distracted by viral posts recommended by algorithm and waste time without realizing. These companies spend millions of dollars to keep you hooked in so it is a game I cannot win. I also become self-conscious on how well my post is doing. I now use my app to schedule ahead and it is especially helpful to publish posts while I sleep. This obviously doesn't solve any inherent issues of social media, but has helped me regulate my use on a personal level.

I also added a few helpful features. The app protects privacy by stripping metadata of any attached media files. It removes any sensitive data such as GPS location or device used, etc. before uploading to the platform servers. It also checks for file size and image dimensions to meet each platform requirements, thus, saving user's time on preparing them. The UI is simple and minimal to keep the time spent on scheduling as little as possible.

Currently, the app is only available behind VPN for a small closed group of people.

For this version, I got a lot of help from AI coding agent. Last summer, I tried Cursor and although it was quite impressive, it also made mistakes that made it quite frustrating to use. I gave another try by using Claude Code this time and I was surprised at how much better it became. I am still skeptical about the overall AI landscape. There are so many things to be concerned about - environmental costs, economic collapse, the consolidation of political power, no compensation to creative people, etc.
