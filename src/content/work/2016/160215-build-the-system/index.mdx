  Designers often work with a system, whether it is a grid on a page or a
  typographical hierarchy. This poster is an exploration into building and
  revealing a system by gradually breaking away from it. In my own design
  practice, I start my process by building a system, usually by means of
  computer programming. Typography in this poster is first created with
  Processing programming language with a few simple rules. Changing a few
  parameters of the rules allows me to explore many forms it can create. But
  eventually, there comes a time when the rigid rules cannot apply any more, and
  that is when the instinct and manual interventions are needed.

  <MediaGrid
    media={[img1, img2, img3, img4]}
    alts={["", "", "", ""]}
    class="gap-8"
  />
