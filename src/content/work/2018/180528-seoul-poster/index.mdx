This poster is my visual response to visiting Seoul in the Summer of 2018. It was very humid and hot. I was soaked wet with sweat everyday. I wanted to find some personal space and relax but everywhere I went, it was filled with people. And a lot of talking. We were talking about tensions and changes between South, North Korea and the United States. And the Summit. I felt energies, hopes and confusions. The city was constantly moving.
